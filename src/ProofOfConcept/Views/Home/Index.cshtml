In Money for Study students are also teachers. They come up more novel and unique ways to present a topic to their peers in order to stand out. Paying students get to decide who gets their money.</p>

                <p>A novice learns and behaves differently from an expert. (Surprise!) Novices need recipes, experts work from intuition. The Dreyfus brothers identify five stages of skill acquisition: Novice, Advanced Beginner, Competent, Proficient and Expert. Depending on what level you are you need different ways to study. These stages are mirrored in Money for Study.</p>
